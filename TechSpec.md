## Technical Specification

### 1. Frontend
- Framework: React (alternatives: Vue or Angular)
- UI components and interactions:
  - Use modular components for each screen (Start, Match, Settings, etc.)
  - Implement touch, mouse, and keyboard interactions using event listeners and handlers

### 2. Backend
- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Framework: Express (alternatives: Django, Gin)
- Game logic, user authentication, and match management:
  - Implement game logic for argument interaction, turn management, and match conclusion
  - Use an authentication library (e.g., Passport) for user authentication and session management
  - Manage match data and communicate with the frontend via WebSocket connections

### 3. Data Storage
- Relational database: PostgreSQL (for long-term data storage)
- NoSQL database: Redis (for temporary data storage and real-time updates)
- Database schema:
  - Users table: stores user information (username, password, email, etc.)
  - Matches table: stores match information (unique match code, players, start time, end time, etc.)
  - Game states table: stores snapshots of each game state, with foreign key references to the matches table
  - Actions table: stores actions taken by players (agree, disagree, propose change), with foreign key references to the game states table and users table
  - Messages table: stores messages attached to actions, with foreign key references to the actions table and users table

### 4. Networking
- WebSocket communication:
  - Use the Socket.IO library for WebSocket communication between the frontend and backend
  - Implement real-time updates and interactions between players by emitting and receiving events through WebSocket connections

### 5. Implementation Plan
- Milestone 1: Set up project structure, frontend framework, and backend framework
- Milestone 2: Implement user interface components and interactions
- Milestone 3: Implement game logic, user authentication, and match management on the backend
- Milestone 4: Design and set up databases and schema
- Milestone 5: Implement networking using WebSocket communication
- Milestone 6: Integrate frontend and backend, test functionality, and fix bugs
- Milestone 7: Deploy the application and perform user acceptance testing
